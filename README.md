# CLI CHESS/Command line based Chess

![Image](./static/draft_image.png)


# this readme is draft, still in development

# When playing, make sure to increase font size and change settings to make board more square-like. On Linux mint terminal for example, this can be done using  Edit -> Preferences -> Cell -> Text Spacing . (1.8-2 seems good enough)


. Maybe add some kind of historical info live visibility like famous players that had similar situations and some link or small info, if game is started in this specific info-ish mode, which can make game a bit more funny  

# todo after basic functionalities
. add good docs for each functions about their input/output and functionalities/roles
. ability to play using 2 different computers on same network using IP sharing
